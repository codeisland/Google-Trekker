googletrekker
=============

Create a community sourced list of locations for the Google Trekker backpack.

This project is in very early stages.

Next step is get a web page that shows a map through the google maps API.



Rough Design
============

Add annotation page:
    Google maps API in a div
    Text box
    Add annotation button

Actions:
    Tap on a location
    When pushing the add location button
        Stuff in an annotations table in the database


Needs a way to view all the annotations
    For aggregation of actual uses
    API to get all points as JSON

Additional features:
    Add a suggestion to someone else's annotations
    Prevent annotations that aren't in Rhode Island
